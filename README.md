# platzfinderLMU
## Content of this Repo
R-Files to analyze a csv containing data from the ["Platzfinder" App at University of Munich](http://www.ub.uni-muenchen.de/arbeiten/platzfinder/index.html).

## Output ideas
Output should be a small data-journalistic piece with the following questions:
* When are the libraries the fullest?
* A GIF showing the fullness per hour
* a plot Showing a comparison between weekday and weekend on the mean of the total filling per hour (line chart)

## Open Questions:
* Should we throw away the Christmas holidays? (24.12.2016 00:00:00 -> 02.01.2017 00:00:00)
